# Codebase for Master's Project on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Environment

The environment is meant to simulate cyclists in a race. The aim is to travel as far as possible. In a multi-agent case, this requires collaborative policies where the agents cycle close together.

## Notes

This is the final approach settled on. Some of the other approaches tested are on the `all-approaches` branch.


### Requirements
* Tensorflow < 2
* Keras (code written for version 2.3.1)
* Code written for Cuda 10.1
