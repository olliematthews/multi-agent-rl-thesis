# Multi Agent, Actor Critic with U-Function

## Environment

This is the more simple multi-agent environment.
* The cyclist's state is defined by a pose, velocity, energy and time, as well as the relative poses, velocities and the total energy of the other cyclists.
* The episode ends **any one** of the cyclists run out of energy or the time runs out.
* The reward is the distance travelled in a step i.e. the cyclist's velocity.
* The cyclist's energy decreases proportionally to $v^3$, multiplied by $c_D$ which depends on the proximity to the rider in front.

## Algorithm

The algorithm is an implementation of the Actor Critic algorithm. We also implement entropy regularisation. Instead of learning a single agent value function, we learn a multi-agent U-Function, which represents:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U(s,\bar{a})&space;=&space;\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_t&space;r_t&space;\middle|&space;s&space;=&space;s,&space;\bar{a}&space;=&space;\bar{a}\right]),

where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bar{a}) represents the actions of all of the agents apart from one partiular agent. This deals with non-stationarity in the multi-agent environment.
