# Single Agent, Reinforce

## Environment

This is a single agent environment, so there is only one cyclist.
* The cyclist's state is defined by a pose, velocity, energy and time.
* The episode ends when the cyclist runs out of time or energy.
* The reward is the distance travelled in a step i.e. the cyclist's velocity.
* The cyclist's energy decreases proportionally to $v^3$.


## Algorithm

The algorithm is an implementation of REINFORCE. The baseline is calculated according to a weighted average of the reward to come from a step, and all advantages are normalised by a rolling standard deviation average.

In this version, the policy is a two layer neural net.
